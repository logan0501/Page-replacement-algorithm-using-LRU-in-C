# Page-replacement-algorithm-using-LRU-in-C
Implementation of page replacement algorithm using Least Recently used scheme in C.

Theory - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-least-recently-used-lru-page-replacement-algorithm/

`Note - I've used array to keep the code simple but LRU Scheme uses Doubly linked list to perform operations less costlier.`
